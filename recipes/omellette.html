    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>8 eggs</li>
        <li>Kosher salt, to taste</li>
        <li>2 tbsp unsalted, melted butter</li>
        <li>5oz cheddar cheese, grated</li>
        <li>6 oz. bacon, diced, cooked until crispy and drained</li>
        <li>1/4 cup thinly sliced green onions, white and light green portions, plus more for garnish</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat an oven to 200Â°F. Place 4 oven-safe plates in the oven.</li>
        <li>Preheat an omelette pan over medium heat.</li>
        <li>In a small bowl, whisk together 2 of the eggs and lightly season with salt. Lightly brush the inside of the pan with one-fourth of the melted butter and pour the eggs into the well closest to the handle. 
            Tilt the pan forward to distribute the eggs evenly between the wells. Cook, tilting and swirling the pan occasionally while lightly scraping the pan sides with the omelette spatula,
            until the eggs are just set, 1 to 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle one-fourth of the cheese, bacon and green onions over the eggs in the well closest to the handle. 
                Starting at this well, use the spatula to gently fold the eggs toward the center divider and continue rolling toward the opposite side of the pan to form the omelette.
                Transfer the omelette to one of the warmed plates in the oven. Repeat the process 3 more times with the remaining ingredients, wiping out the pan with a paper towel as needed.
            </li>
            <li>Garnish the omelettes with green onions and serve immediately. Makes 4 omelettes.
